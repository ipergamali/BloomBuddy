# BloomBuddy
Bloom Buddy is a cozy virtual plant widget for your desktop.
Every day you power on your computer, your little green friend grows — one leaf, one petal, one step at a time.

The widget keeps track of your “growth streak” and changes its appearance daily or based on activity.
If you neglect it for too long, it may wilt — but with care, it’ll bloom again 🌸.

Features include:
• Daily plant growth stages (seed → sprout → bloom)
• Simple progress bar or level indicator
• Local data persistence (JSON or text file)
• Optional animations for growing leaves 🌱
• Zen ambient theme and background
